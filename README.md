# 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors – Python Game

A sarcastically charming command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Python. Play against the computer, get insulted by your own code, and spiral into endless rematches until you give up or your keyboard breaks.

## 🎮 Features

- Human vs CPU gameplay
- Case-insensitive input (because we're merciful)
- Dramatic win/lose/draw reactions
- Input validation for those who type “rokc”
- “Play again” loop until you pretend you're productive again

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Clone this repo like it’s the last bus home:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/radhika863/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd Rock-Paper-Scissors

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python rps.py

## 📄 File Info

- rps.py: The main script. Pure drama.
- README.md: This thing. You're reading it.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Because learning Python is fun, but yelling “SCISSORS BEATS PAPER” at a terminal window is therapy.
